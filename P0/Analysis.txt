Task 0

The arrays are accessed by an index. The Worst-Case Big-O is O(1)
Overall complexity is O(n)


Task 1

For the loops the complexity is O(n)
For the "not in" operators, the complexity is O(n)

Overall complexity is O(n)

Task 2

For the loops the complexity is O(n)
Overall complexity is O(n)

Task 3

For the loops the complexity is O(n)
For sorts,  the complexity is O(n log(n))
For larger values, O(n log(n)) is > O(n)

The overall complexity is O(n log(n)) + O)n) which is O(n log(n)) for larger values of n

Task 4

For the loops the complexity is O(n)
For sorts,  the complexity is O(n log(n))
For larger values, O(n log(n)) is > O(n)

The overall complexity is O(n log(n)) + O)n) which is O(n log(n)) for larger values of n
